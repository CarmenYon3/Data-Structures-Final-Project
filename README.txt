In this program, the user is able to add and remove files while being able to access previous versions of those files.
The user is asked if they want to initialize a new repository
If so, the user is prompted with a menu where they decide what function of the program they want to use:
1) Add a new file to the repository. If the file name is already taken, the file name will be updated with its version number.
2) Remove a file from the repository. If the inputted file name exists, remove that file from the repository.
3) Commit changes made. If the user made any changes to the files in the repository, the program will save and store those changes so that they can be accessed in the future.
